// Amelia II - User visible changes

//

== 1.2-16 (20 Mar 2010)  ==
   * Fixed a bug when priors specified. 
   * When priors are used, Amelia now tries to use starting values 
   with the prior-filled data. 


== 1.2-15 (20 Feb 2010)  ==
   * Fixed a bug when only 1 variable is not an ID variable or a
   nominal/ordinal variable. 
   * Fixed a bug with the naming of columns in the imputation
   process. 

== 1.2-14 (16 Nov 2009)  == 

   *  Fixed a bug that "ords" variables would return multiple copies
      of the same level.  


== 1.2-13 (09 Aug 2009)  == 

   *  Fixed a small bug in the error checking routines that handled
      nominal variables. 

== 1.2-12 (11 Jul 2009)  == 

   *  Fixed a bug in AmeliaView that caused it to crash.

== 1.2-11 (10 Jul 2009)  == 

   * Minor bugfixes in removing test code from AmeliaView() and
     handling of the priors.


== 1.2-10 (07 Jul 2009)  == 

   * Fixed a bug in the error checking routine that occurred when
     users put all of their variables into one of (idvars, noms,
     ords, ts, cs).


== 1.2-9 (02 Jul 2009) ==

   * Fixed typos in the manual with regard to ridge priors and
     clarified the advice about them.



=== 1.2-8 (01 Jul 2009) ==

    * Major update to the Amelia manual (now compiled as a vignette 
      using Sweave).
    
    * Changed a typo that stated values were the "percent missing" 
      when they should have been "fraction missing." This is fixed. 



=== 1.2-7 (29 Jul 2009) ==

    * In the amelia output, mu and covMatrices now have relevant
      dimension names to be able to tell which column which.

    * Fixed a bug in the handling of priors that may have affected
      answers, but not significantly.

    * The missmap() function can now accept any matrix or data.frame,
      not just Amelia output. This allows for drawing a missingness
      map before running amelia().


== 1.2-0 (09 Apr 2009) == 

    * Amelia output is now an instance of the S3 class 'amelia'. 

    * Imputations are now stored in a list of length 'm' (the number
      of imputations) in output$imputations, which is of the class
      'mi', making it simple to pass to Zelig. 

    * Amelia output contains a matrix of means (one column for each
      imputation) and an array of covariance matrices. These are the
      posterior modes found by the EM algorithm in each imputation.
